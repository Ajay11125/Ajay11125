I am a highly motivated and cheerful person. I always try to find a way to grow myself more and more and made myself a more Better version of myself. I am also trying to involve myself in Extracurricular activities so that won't become a one-track person, I am frank in nature which makes me a good team player and as a Team player I have a good habit of never giving up which also motivates others to work harder I also have leadership skills which I learn from my NCC Experience, I have a bad habit to try to do things perfectly so sometimes I overdo myself, I am skilled in my work and always ready to learn new things Thank you.
